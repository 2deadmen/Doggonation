In this project, we performed text speech analysis using various natural language processing techniques to extract insights from textual data. We utilized tools such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition to gain a deeper understanding of the language used in our dataset.

Our sentiment analysis, as depicted in the above image, revealed a generally positive sentiment towards our product. This information can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.
