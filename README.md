<h2>Firebase auth for Google and Facebook </h2>
<p>This project utilizes Firebase Authentication for user authentication, specifically for Google and Facebook sign in. Firebase Authentication provides a secure and easy-to-use way to authenticate users, and supports multiple authentication providers, including email and password, phone number, and third-party providers like Google and Facebook.</p>
    <p>To implement Firebase Authentication in this project, we followed the guidelines and best practices outlined in the Firebase Authentication documentation. You can find more information about Firebase Authentication and how to use it in your own projects in the official Firebase Authentication documentation.</p>
    <p>We believe that Firebase Authentication provides a robust and reliable authentication solution that meets the needs of our project and our users. By leveraging Firebase Authentication, we can ensure that user data is secure and protected, and that our application is easy to use and access for all of our users.</p>
    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/?hl=en&authuser=0">here are the docs you can refer to use firebase auth </a>
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>Doggonation is built using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>React with Vite for the frontend</li>
  <li>Redux for state Management</li>
  <li>Flask for the backend API</li>
  <li>Azure MySQL for the SQL database hosting</li>
  <li>Azure App Services for hosting the backend</li>
  <li>Azure Cognitive Services for translation (coming soon)</li>
</ul>


<h2>CI/CD using GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>This repository implements continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for frontend React and backend Flask code, using GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a platform that allows for the creation of automated workflows, including continuous integration and deployment, for software development.</p>
<h2>Workflows</h2>
<p>The repository has two main workflows:</p>
<h3>1. Frontend React Workflow</h3>
<p>The workflow runs whenever a pull request is created or updated. It checks the frontend React code for linting errors and runs unit tests. If any of the tests fail, the workflow will fail and prevent merging the pull request.</p>
<h3>2. Backend Flask Workflow</h3>
<p>The workflow runs whenever a pull request is created or updated. It checks the backend Flask code for linting errors and runs unit tests. If any of the tests fail, the workflow will fail and prevent merging the pull request.</p>
<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>By using GitHub Actions, we can ensure that every pull request to the repository is automatically checked for code quality and unit tests. This means that any errors can be detected early in the development process, saving time and effort in the long run.</p>
<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
<p>Using GitHub Actions, we can also automate the deployment process for our applications. We can set up a workflow that deploys our code to a staging environment for testing and then to production once it has been approved. This ensures that our code is always up-to-date and running smoothly.</p>

## Text Speech Analysis

![Sentiment Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akashgreninja/helper-repository-for-doggo-nation/main/sentiment_analysis.jpg)

In this project, we performed text speech analysis using various natural language processing techniques to extract insights from textual data. We utilized tools such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition to gain a deeper understanding of the language used in our dataset.

Our sentiment analysis, as depicted in the above image, revealed a generally positive sentiment towards our product. This information can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.

Here's another image that shows the word cloud generated from our dataset:
